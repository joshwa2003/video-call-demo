## Problem
- Mobile users' video frames don't resize properly when viewed on desktop
- Desktop users see inconsistent frame sizes when mobile users join
- Need to ensure all video streams use same desktop frame size regardless of source device

## Plan Steps
- [x] Analyze current code structure
- [x] Modify addVideoStream function in script.js for desktop view consistency
- [x] Update CSS rules to ensure uniform video sizing on desktop
- [x] Verify implementation is complete

## Files Modified
- public/script.js - Added consistent video properties for desktop view
- public/style.css - Added specific CSS rules for video-grid video elements

## Changes Made
1. **script.js**: Modified addVideoStream function to apply consistent styling properties to all video elements in desktop view:
   - Added explicit style properties for width, height, object-fit, border-radius, background-color, transform, border, and box-shadow
   - Ensures all video streams use identical sizing regardless of source device type

2. **style.css**: Added specific CSS rules with !important declarations to ensure uniform video sizing in desktop grid:
   - Added `.video-grid video` selector with enforced styling properties
   - Prevents any device-specific styling from affecting desktop view

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…

## Solution Summary
The issue where mobile users' video frames didn't resize properly when viewed on desktop has been fixed by:
- Enforcing consistent video element styling in the `addVideoStream` function for desktop layout
- Adding CSS rules that override any inconsistent styling with `!important` declarations
- Ensuring all video streams in desktop view use identical dimensions and properties regardless of their source device
